	<string name="about_text">This is some really great information about Lucky Paws Boarding and Day Care, which is located in Clinton, NC. This text will be written by Karen to say whatever she wants about policies, legal junk and all that.\n\nThere will be line breaks and stuff so the text can be broken up and it will scroll. So you can talk about what you expect from pet owners and their dogs while they are using your services.\n\nYou can mention things like group play and how you strive to keep the animals safe, but that sometimes stuff happens. You can talk about medicine and stuff. I don\'t know. It\'s really up to you.</string>
